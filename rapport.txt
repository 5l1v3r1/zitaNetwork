    - how network work ? (protocols - packets - gateway)
    - danger of man in the middle attacks 
    - insecure http

3- why python3

4- introduction to scapy

5- Setting the lab

6- ARP scanning:
    - Different method to scan a network for hosts
    - why is scanning is important before an attack (hacking methodology : information gathering)
    - explaining the ARP protocol (capture arp table of windows victim)

7- Changing MAC before an attack:
    - why change mac ?
    - how to change mac in linux (linux commands)

I- simple attacks

8- ARP spoofing
    - how to exploit ARP weakness
    - explain the spoof function line by line
    - executing the attack and showing result (the victim arp table)
    - follow ups attacks
